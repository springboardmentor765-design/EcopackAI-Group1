🌱 EcoPackAI-
AI-Powered Sustainable Packaging Recommendation System

EcoPackAI is an AI-powered full-stack web application designed to help industries and e-commerce businesses choose eco-friendly, cost-effective, and sustainable packaging materials.
Traditional packaging solutions heavily rely on non-biodegradable materials, leading to increased environmental damage, carbon footprint, and financial inefficiencies. Many organizations lack intelligent decision-support systems to evaluate sustainable alternatives without compromising durability, safety, or cost.
EcoPackAI addresses this problem by using machine learning models to analyze packaging materials based on sustainability metrics and provide data-driven recommendations.
